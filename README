A couple of days ago I have found this blog post http://www.jperla.com/blog/post/capturing-frames-from-a-webcam-on-linux, "Capturing frames from a webcam on Linux", which I found to be a great starting point on fiddeling around with a webcam from python. This script adds motion detection to the code I've taken from the original blogpost.

To get started you should have two python libraries, PyGame and OpenCV, installed. On Ubuntu that would be:

  sudo apt-get install python-pygame python-opencv

Once you have those, just make MotionDetect.py executable

  chmod 755 MotionDetect.py

and run it.

You should see a 640x480 window with video from your webcam. When any movement is detected, you'll get and "Achtung!!!" message on your console (or whatever you have configured as stdout).
